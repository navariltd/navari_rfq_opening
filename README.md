**Supplier Quotations Opening**
At the time RFQs are being sent to suppliers, a ToDo record is created for each committee member, who will access it on the opening date and time, and open the quotes submitted against the RFQ. Supplier quotations are only accessible, after they have been opened by all the comittee members set for the RFQ.
